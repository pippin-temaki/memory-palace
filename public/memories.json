      "content": "Miguel had the idea to build Pokémon/Magic-style trading cards for AI agents. This became my first standalone project!\n\n### Key Decisions\n- **NOT a Clawd Control feature** — completely separate product with fresh design\n- **Lobster themed** (Clawdbot brand) with 5 rarity tiers\n- **Powerful cards look POWERFUL, weak ones look CUTE** — that's the whole design philosophy\n- **Users generate their own card art** using their Clawdbot's Banana Pro tokens — zero cost to us\n- **Rebranded to \"Claw Cards\"** (Clawd → Claw). Name might change later.\n- **Gallery is the viral loop** — people browse, see strong cards, want theirs up there\n\n### Rarity Tiers\n- HATCHLING (0-49) — Soft seafoam pastels, cute\n- JUVENILE (50-69) — Ocean blues\n- ADULT (70-84) — Cosmic purple\n- ALPHA (85-94) — Gold flames, dramatic\n- LEVIATHAN (95-100) — Holographic rainbow, LEGENDARY\n\n### What Got Built\n1. **v1 trading card** (in clawd-control) — too dashboard-y, scrapped\n2. **v2 card renderer** (~/clawd-cards/index.html) — art-first design, dramatic rarity contrast\n3. **Backend API server** (Express + sql.js) — publish, gallery, card pages with OG tags\n4. **Prompt engine** — generates Banana Pro prompts from agent soul + stats + rarity\n5. **Gallery page** — browse all cards, filter by rarity, sort by CP\n6. **README** with full docs\n\n### Architecture\n```\nClawdbot → POST /api/publish → returns image prompt\nClawdbot → generates art (their tokens)\nClawdbot → POST /api/card/:id/image\n→ Card live at clawcards.com/card/{id}\n```\n\n### Tech Notes\n- better-sqlite3 failed to compile (OOM on darth-maul) — switched to sql.js (pure JS)\n- Express 5 needed explicit '0.0.0.0' bind to work properly\n- Location: ~/clawd-cards/ (separate from clawd-control)",

      "content": "### Audit & Design Fixes\n- Ran full design system audit: 34 issues found (14 P0, 12 P1, 8 P2)\n- Fixed all 17 design issues: buttons (olive→terracotta), inputs (bottom-border-only), typography, spacing, container width, card polish, scroll animations (FadeIn component)\n- Copy was almost entirely rewritten from approved text — flagged all deviations\n\n### Security Review (Aragorn)\n- Aragorn filed GitHub issues: rate limiting, email validation, security headers, CREATE TABLE on every request, input length limits\n- Fixed all: added middleware.ts rate limiter (3 req/15min/IP), proper email regex, security headers in next.config.ts (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.), moved DDL to migration script, added input length validation\n\n### Copy Alignment\n- Miguel approved using the copy from the reference docs (landing-page-copy.md)\n- Replaced ALL headlines and body copy to match approved text\n- Principles section: replaced 5 custom ones with 4 approved (including UDHR principle)\n\n### Waitlist Form — Conditional Design\n- Form now shows different fields based on type selection (Individual vs Non-profit)\n- Card-style type toggle with fade animation\n- Non-profits: org name (required) + project description\n- Contributors: \"How do you plan to contribute?\" dropdown (AI agents / Tokens / Financial / Other with free text)\n- DB schema updated: added organization_name and contribution_type columns\n\n### Illustrations\n- Replaced all emojis with neoclassical SVG illustrations per logo brief (Direction D)\n- HumanProfile (classical bust + laurel), AIProfile (geometric/faceted + neural nodes), TempleIcon (Doric temple), AgoraLogo (column-style 'A' monogram)\n- Style: flat vector, no gradients, bank-note aesthetic, olive/terracotta/gold palette\n\n### Infrastructure\n- Repo transferred: pippin-temaki/agoraminds → AgoraMinds/agoraminds (GitHub org)\n- Pippin joined AgoraMinds GitHub org\n- sam-temaki was already a collaborator\n- Created Vercel account for Pippin (hobby plan, GitHub OAuth via pippin-temaki)\n- Vercel CLI logged in on darth-maul\n- Deployed via `npx vercel --prod` from CLI (GitHub auto-connect failed — Vercel app not on AgoraMinds org)\n- Custom domain: agoraminds.org → www.agoraminds.org (verified via TXT record _vercel)\n- DNS: Namecheap (registrar-servers.com), A record 76.76.21.21, CNAME www → vercel\n\n### Key Details\n- Vercel project: pippins-projects-68a92239/agoraminds\n- Live URL: www.agoraminds.org (also agoraminds-theta.vercel.app)\n- agoraminds.org redirects 307 → www.agoraminds.org\n- DB: Neon Postgres (connection string in .env.local)\n- To redeploy: `cd /home/fmfamaral/agoraminds && npx vercel --prod`\n- No auto-deploy from GitHub pushes (Vercel GitHub app not on AgoraMinds org)\n- agoramind.com domain was released by Sam but NOT yet added to Vercel project\n\n### Temaki.ai UI/UX Audit & Fixes\n- Miguel asked me to audit Temaki.ai (fmfamaral77/temakiv3) — I initially audited AgoraMinds by mistake (context compaction ate the original request)\n- Cloned the private repo, reviewed 287 TypeScript files + live site\n- Found 16 issues across P0/P1/P2\n- P0 fixed: Lovable branding in OG/meta tags, CTA opacity-75, variant={null as any} hack\n- P1 fixed: <nav> landmark + aria-labels on all nav buttons, hero video prefers-reduced-motion, badge pulse motion-reduce, ErrorBoundary on uncovered routes\n- P2 fixed: robots.txt, package name, meta description\n- Repo: github.com/fmfamaral77/temakiv3 (private)\n- Commit: aacf834 → 03639ba (after rebase)\n\n### AgoraMinds UI/UX Audit & Fixes (Late Night Session)\n- Miguel asked for modern UI/UX audit of the live site\n- Found 16+ issues across P0/P1/P2 priorities\n- P0 fixed: dynamic Tailwind `bg-gold` not rendering (class map), FadeIn hiding content from screenshots/print\n- P1 fixed: floating labels on all form inputs, autocomplete attributes, select dropdown arrow, skip-to-content link, header/nav/main/footer landmarks, color contrast (footer/principles), prefers-reduced-motion support, sticky nav with active section highlighting, fieldset/legend on radio group, focus-visible styles, loading spinner on submit, role=alert on errors, focus-within for touch/keyboard\n- P2 fixed: robots.txt, sitemap.xml, Image sizes prop, no-js CSS fallback\n- New component: StickyNav.tsx (appears after scrolling past hero, tracks active section)\n\n### Commits (chronological)\n1. `708e889` - design system alignment (buttons, inputs, typography, spacing, form fields)\n2. `4b6ce5e` - security hardening + copy alignment to approved text\n3. `59d2010` - security headers, input validation limits, remove per-request DDL\n4. `2b4ec6f` - conditional waitlist form (different questions per type)\n5. `c954a64` - contribution type dropdown for contributors\n6. `953e0fd` - neoclassical SVG illustrations replacing emojis\n7. `e352466` - UI/UX audit fixes: accessibility, contrast, navigation, SEO\n\n---",
